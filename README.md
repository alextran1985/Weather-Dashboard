# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple citiesso that I can plan a trip accordingly.
Given a weather dashboard with form inputs when I search for a city then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When I view current weather conditions for that city then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. When I view future weather conditions for that city Then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
